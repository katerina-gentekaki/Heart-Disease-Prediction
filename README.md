# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. It compares two classification algorithms ‚Äî Logistic Regression and Decision Tree ‚Äî and selects the better-performing model based on accuracy and F1 score.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains clinical data collected from patients, with the following features:

- **age**: Age in years  
- **sex**: Biological sex (1 = male, 0 = female)  
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0‚Äì3)  
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)  
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0‚Äì2)  
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved  
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)  
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
- **slope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment (0‚Äì2)  
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0‚Äì3)  
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)  
- **target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Exploration

- Checked for **null values** and **duplicates**, and cleaned the dataset accordingly.
- Performed exploratory data analysis:
  - Gender distribution of heart disease
  - Age distribution
  - Distribution of resting blood pressure (`trestbps`)
  - Serum cholesterol (`chol`) distribution
  - Correlation heatmap between features

## üìä Model Building

- The data was split into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Two classification models were trained and evaluated:
  1. **Logistic Regression**
  2. **Decision Tree Classifier**

## ‚úÖ Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**

| Model              | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (%) |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression |   _81.97%_ |   _83.08%_   |
| Decision Tree       |   _77.05%_ |   _78.79%_   |

‚Üí Logistic Regression performed better and was selected for prediction.

## üîç Prediction Example

A random patient input was used to test the trained Logistic Regression model:

```python
input_data = pd.DataFrame(
    [[41, 0, 1, 130, 204, 0, 0, 172, 0, 1.4, 2, 0, 2]],
    columns=['age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg',
             'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']
)
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
